The theta functions \PMlinkescapetext{satisfy} the following partial differential equation:
 $${\pi i \over 4} {\partial^2 \vartheta_i \over \partial z^2} + {\partial \vartheta_i \over \partial \tau} = 0$$

It is easy to check that each \PMlinkescapetext{term} in the series which define the theta functions \PMlinkescapetext{satisfies} this differential equation.  Furthermore, by the Weierstrass M-test, the series obtained by differentiating the series which define the theta functions term-by-term converge absolutely, and hence one may compute derivatives of the theta functions by taking derivatives of the series term-by-term.

Students of mathematical physics will recognize this equation as a one-dimensional diffusion equation.  Furthermore, as may be seen by examining the series defining the theta functions, the theta functions approach periodic delta distributions in the limit $\tau \to 0$.  Hence, the theta functions are the Green's functions of the one-dimensional diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions.
