Let $E\subset W$ where $E$ is an open subset of $W$ which is a normed vector space, and let $f$ be a continuous differentiable map
$$f: E \to W.$$  Then the ordinary differential equation defined as 
$$\dot{x} = f(x)$$
with the initial condition
$$x(0) = x_0$$
where $x_0 \in E$ has a unique solution on some interval containing zero.  More specifically there exists $\alpha>0$ such that the following is a unique function 
$$x:(-\alpha,\alpha) \to E$$
such that $\dot{x}=f\circ x$ and $x(0)=x_0$.\cite{HS}
