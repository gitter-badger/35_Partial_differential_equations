\begin{document}
Let $E\subset W$ where $W$ is a normed vector space, $f\in C^1(E)$ is a continuous differentiable map $f: E \to W$. Furthermore consider the ordinary differential equation
$$\dot{x} = f(x)$$
with the initial condition
\begin{center}
$x(0) = x_0$.
\end{center}
Let $x(t)$ be the solution of the above initial value problem defined as
$$x:I \to E$$
where $I = [-a,a]$.  Then there exist $\delta >0$ such that for all $y_0 \in N_\delta (x_0)$\textit{($y_0$ in the $\delta$ neighborhood of $x_0$)} has a unique solution $y(t)$ to the initial value problem above except for the initial value changed to $x(0)=y_0$.  In addition $y(t)$ is twice continouously differentialble function of $t$ over the interval $I$.
